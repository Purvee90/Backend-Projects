# ðŸ‘‹ Hi Team!

Iâ€™ve built a **Task Planner CLI** as my first backend project! ðŸŽ‰  
This project is part of the roadmap.sh backend development journey and is designed to help manage tasks efficiently from the command line.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The Task Planner CLI is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to manage their daily tasks directly from the terminal. It reinforces backend fundamentals such as CLI design, file handling, and data persistence.

## âœ¨ Features

- `add`: Add a new task with a description and due date
- `update`: Modify an existing task
- `delete`: Remove a task by ID
- `list`: Display all tasks
- `complete`: Mark a task as completed
- `filter`: View tasks by status or due date

## ðŸ›  Installation

cd weather_backend_roadmaps
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
