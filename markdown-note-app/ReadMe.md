ðŸ§­ Recommended Development Flow
1. Project Structure & Environment Setup
Create your folder structure.
Set up a virtual environment.
Create requirements.txt and install dependencies.


2. Define Models First
Start with models because they define your data structure.
Use SQLAlchemy or your preferred ORM.
This helps you understand what data you'll be working with and how endpoints will interact with it.


3. Set Up app.py
Initialize Flask (or FastAPI) app.
Configure database connection.
Register blueprints or routes.


4. Create Utility Modules
Markdown rendering
Grammar checking
File handling (if needed)


5. Build Endpoints
Implement routes one by one:
Start with simple ones like GET /list-notes
Then move to POST /save-note, POST /check-grammar, etc.


6. Testing
Use tools like pytest or Postman to test endpoints.
Validate grammar suggestions, Markdown rendering, and DB operations.

7. Documentation
Add docstrings and optionally Swagger/OpenAPI docs.
