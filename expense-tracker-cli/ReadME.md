# ðŸ§¾ Expense Tracker CLI

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application to manage your personal finances. Built as part of the [roadmap.sh backend development journey](https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker), this project helps reinforce core backend concepts like CLI design, file handling, and data persistence.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This CLI tool allows users to:
- Add, update, and delete expenses
